# Data-Incubator-Challenge

## Project Description
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time market index representing the market's expectation of 30-day forward looking volatility. It provides a measure of market risk and investors' sentiments. It is also known by other names like "Fear Gauge" or "Fear Index." VIX is important for investors, research analysts and portfolio managers to measure market risks, fear and stress before taking investment decisions. 
        This project aims to use predictive modeling to estimate the change in VIX. This project will also research on additional factors that are potentially relevant with VIX changes. The results of the project can be used for VIX prediction and served as another guidance for investment decisions.
